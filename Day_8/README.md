Day 8 Challenge: Metaballs

This challenge is a challenge and this will really encourage you to get your hands dirty with scss/sass which i surely did.

So you'll learn/practice about:
- animation again
- ::after selector
- transform-origin importance
- and where the magic happens: filters
- additional scss/sass
