Day 9 Challenge: Rainy Night

This challenge need sync with other elements of the scene like droplets:
- that need to have some amount of distance to see them seperately
-  and also there speed may vary accoriding to the size of droplets
-  and it should seems random so that it doesn't feel fixed 
-  sass/scss would be a great help
